## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a CSE student focused on **backend engineering and system-level understanding**.  
My primary interest lies in building **reliable Java backends** and learning how systems work beyond just writing code.

I value:
- strong fundamentals
- clean, readable logic
- understanding *why* things work

Currently focusing on:
- Core Java (OOP, Collections, Streams, Exceptions)
- Linux fundamentals & system concepts
- Spring Boot for backend development
